prototype-and-refactor
======================

This is short and hopefuly simple enough demo of how to prototype and refactor to something usable when using Nette and Kdyby\Doctrine.
Last change (previous commit) is peek into the future where less code is written while still maintaining same functionality.
Code only contains relevant parts, rest is left to your imagination. Any constructive comments and ideas are welcome.
